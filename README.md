# KNN_Using_Tangent_Distance
A project in which I plan on using tangent distance instead of Euclidean, Manhattan or other similarity functions for finding image similarlity using KNN(K nearest neigbours). The images/data I will be using will be from the "Ancient Greek Characters". More description will be added as the project evolves.
